# Leather_Defect_Detector

explanation for main.py: 

This Project is about identifying the leather defect and the type of the defect and finding the surface of the leather material.
the libraries for numerical computations and dataframe manipulations and preprocessing are being imported
then the dataset is loaded by seperating them into two lists in which one carries images and other carries its labels
the training is done and training and testing data is seperated
Convolutional neural network model is trained,compiled,fitted and evaluated
model is given for prediction
output defines the type of defect in the inp[ut image

the second part is determining the contour of the given image
here one 10 cm of an image is taken by 0.1 pixel.
with this number of pixels are found from the contour and the surface area is determined.
